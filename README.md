This project is a Resume Classifier that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to categorize resumes into predefined job roles such as Engineering, Healthcare, Banking, HR, and more. The resumes are first preprocessed using standard NLP techniques including text cleaning and stopword removal. A CNN model is trained on the cleaned data to learn classification patterns. The model was trained on over 2,000 real-world resumes and achieved high accuracy, especially after applying text augmentation techniques. The final model is deployed using Streamlit as an interactive web app where users can upload a resume PDF and instantly get the predicted job category.
