This project is a resume classification system built using NLP and deep learning, capable of classifying uploaded PDF resumes into 24+ job roles such as HR, IT, Finance, and more. It includes a Streamlit-based frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI-powered backend for scalable inference. The pipeline covers PDF parsing (using PyMuPDF), text preprocessing (with NLTK), data augmentation, and a CNN-based multi-class classification model trained on 2,400+ resumes with an accuracy of 88%. The complete application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and supports future integration with job portals, ATS systems, or HR tools.
