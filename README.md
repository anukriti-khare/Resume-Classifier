This project implements a Resume Classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It processes a dataset of 2,484 labeled PDF resumes across 24+ job categories such as HR, IT, Finance, and Engineering. The pipeline includes text extraction from PDFs using PyMuPDF, data cleaning, augmentation, and tokenization. A CNN model is trained on the processed text and achieves ~88% accuracy in classifying resumes into their respective domains. The project showcases skills in text preprocessing, deep learning, and multi-class classification.
