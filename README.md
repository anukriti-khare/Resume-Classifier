This project is a resume classification system built using NLP and deep learning, capable of classifying uploaded PDF resumes into 24+ job roles such as HR, IT, Finance, and more. Built with a Streamlit frontend for interactive resume upload and prediction, it also includes a FastAPI backend exposing a /predict endpoint for JSON-based inference, simulating production deployment. The model is trained on over 2,400 real-world resumes, achieving 88% test accuracy. Key components include PDF parsing with PyMuPDF, custom text preprocessing, tokenization, augmentation, and early stopping. The complete application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.
